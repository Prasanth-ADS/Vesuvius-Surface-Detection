# Vesivus-Surface-Detection
Building a deep-learning surface detection system for the Vesuvius Challenge using optimized U-Net/ResNet models and multi-scale inference to detect ink patterns in 3D CT scroll data.Advancing computational archaeology by improving voxel accuracy and enabling recovery of ancient text without unwrapping the scrolls.
